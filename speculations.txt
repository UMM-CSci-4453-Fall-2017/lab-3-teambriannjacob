-How will inventory be tracked?
The inventory will be tracked with multiple tables with each table having a reference/relationship to other tables.
-Should the system keep track of vendors?
Yes it will make it harder to maintain the data but will be beneficial in the long run because we will be able to compare vendor prices.
-What about the people working the tills (cash registers)?
--Should the system track when they log into a till?
Yes, they should  be able to login into the til for administrative, security and management purposes. This is an example of checking of 
how much is actually in the till vs what was accounted for
--Should the system track how long an interaction takes place (efficiency?).
Yes because then we will be able to tell whether the connections/relationships we have between tables in our database is correct and
efficient. 
--Should the system try to help with up-selling? (suggesting other merchandise... would you like a drink with that?)
Yes because the customer might want different options so if I a customer chooses to buy a burger then a variety of combos containing
that certain burger could persuade them to change their mind.
-How should it deal with
-items sold by unit: The till should be able to recall a certain item and enter it into a different table with the certain quantity 
entered.
-items sold by volume: The till should be able to recall a certain item that is sold by volume with the price per volume listed and is 
then multiplied by the actual checkout volume of that item.
-items part of a combination deal: Items sold apart of a combination deals would recognize an item apart of a combination deal/s then 
would list the combos for that item else they could also just buy. 
-sale items: Items that are apart of a sale would have a separate table for sales that the item/s would correspond to depending what kind
of sale they are apart of. 
-promotional items: Items that are part of a promotional deal would have a table like the sale items but would have a limited time 
interval which would end when the promotional deal ends.
-Coupons: It would apply certain percentage that an individual item price or overall final checkout price then it would subtract it 
automatically. 
-Refunds: The database should recall the certain item that is trying to be refunded from the item inventory table listing the price and 
quantity that the store contains. Then the price would be refunded and the quantity  incremented. 
-mistakes: You should be able to cancel an item if it's on the till list and give you a final warning before checking out making sure you
double check the list you are about to purchase.
-How independent should the individual tills be?
--Can the tills operate if the local network is down?
It should be able to operate, maybe by creating a temporary database which is stored on the til and then updated when the network is 
updated.
--What is stored on the server? And What is stored on the till?
The server stores most if not all the data tables with containing all the metadata. It would not store the current items being checked 
out, prices, quantity,etc. Then at the end of the checkout it would send all the data from the till to the server
